It's a simple bat compressed into an sfx 7z and renamed to exe.

Before using it you need to have installed first :

* Node.js
* npm
* lua
* luamin (https://github.com/mathiasbynens/luamin)

The 7z files is just here if you want to check source.

After all requires are setup, download Yaddle Minify fusion tool.exe, put it in the same folder than the script you want to minify.

Then execute it and follow steps.

Note : if you don't want to install lua globally (in your PATH), you have to put the fusion tool exe and your script in your lua folder.
